(* created a find max function that returns an option, I initially created it where the recursive function was using the x::xs pattern match, this can work if you use the #index notation, and ends up being less efficient, this is also tail recursive as it requires no further computation after the base case is reached *)

(* working towards a quick sort function, this will involve partitioning, and then comparing values in seperate lists, the optimal situation seems to be where the lists are of similar lenghts *)
